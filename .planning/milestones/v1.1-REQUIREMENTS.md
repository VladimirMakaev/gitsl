# Requirements: GitSL v1.1

**Defined:** 2026-01-18
**Core Value:** Git commands execute correctly against Sapling repos without the calling tool knowing the difference.

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for v1.1 Polish & Documentation release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Cleanup

- [x] **CLEAN-01**: Remove external tool references from codebase
- [x] **CLEAN-02**: Remove external tool references from comments/docs

### Testing

- [x] **TEST-01**: `./test` script runs all tests
- [x] **TEST-02**: `./test <command>` runs tests for specific command only
- [x] **TEST-03**: Test script works on MacOS, Linux, Windows
- [x] **TEST-04**: Audit existing tests for completeness gaps
- [x] **TEST-05**: Add tests for edge cases (empty repos, special characters, large files)
- [x] **TEST-06**: Add tests for error conditions (missing sl, invalid args)
- [x] **TEST-07**: Add tests for flag combinations not currently covered

### Packaging

- [x] **PACK-01**: pyproject.toml defines package metadata and entry points
- [x] **PACK-02**: `pip install gitsl` installs package from PyPI *(completed with v1.0.1 release)*
- [x] **PACK-03**: `gitsl` command available in PATH after install
- [x] **PACK-04**: Package version matches git tag

### CI/CD

- [x] **CI-01**: GitHub Actions workflow runs tests on push/PR
- [x] **CI-02**: Test matrix covers MacOS, Linux, Windows
- [x] **CI-03**: CI installs Sapling on each platform
- [x] **CI-04**: Release workflow publishes to PyPI on version tag
- [x] **CI-05**: Trusted publishing configured (no API tokens in secrets)

### Documentation

- [x] **DOC-01**: README.md with installation instructions
- [x] **DOC-02**: README.md with quick start / usage examples
- [x] **DOC-03**: README.md with command support matrix (supported vs unsupported)
- [x] **DOC-04**: Per-command flag documentation with support status
- [x] **DOC-05**: Unsupported commands/flags include reason why
- [x] **DOC-06**: CI status badge in README
- [x] **DOC-07**: PyPI version badge in README
- [x] **DOC-08**: Python version badge in README

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Extended Command Support

- **CMD-01**: Implement additional git commands based on v1.1 research
- **CMD-02**: Add new flag support for existing commands

### Advanced Features

- **ADV-01**: Configuration file support
- **ADV-02**: Plugin system for custom command handlers

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| New command implementations | v1.1 is documentation/polish only; new commands are v2 |
| Matching git diff output exactly | Pass-through is sufficient |
| OAuth/authentication handling | Sapling handles this |
| Remote operations (push/pull/fetch) | Sapling model differs fundamentally |
| Interactive commands (rebase -i, add -p) | Require terminal control |

## Traceability
